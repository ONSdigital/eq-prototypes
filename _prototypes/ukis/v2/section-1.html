The data collected also serves as an important contributor to the Community Innovation Survey conducted across Europe, which is used for international benchmarking and comparison purposes. We are interested in responses from both businesses conducting innovation and businesses not currently engaged in innovation as this can help to inform our wider understanding of the constraining factors.</p></div>
